Currently, there is a challenge in properly following up on ongoing issues and tickets due to the absence of an efficient handover process.

The Campfire solution aims to streamline the handover process, ensuring that important information is shared accurately and comprehensively between shifts and staff, facilitating better tracking and resolution of ongoing issues and tickets.","The PowerApp facilitates clear and concise communication between shifts by providing a centralized platform for sharing information. This reduces the chances of miscommunication or important details getting lost, ensuring that everyone is on the same page.
